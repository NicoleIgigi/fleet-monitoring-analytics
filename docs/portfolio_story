# Project story: System Health Monitoring for a Delivery Fleet

## Problem
Systems engineering teams need fast, reliable visibility into fleet health.
This project builds a monitoring analytics pipeline that turns raw logs into:
- reliability KPIs (success rate, failure rate per 100 flights)
- safety signals (critical event rate)
- incident summaries (top vehicles/routes, recurring issues)

## Users
- Executives: weekly reliability and safety trends
- Engineers: drill-down by vehicle, route, event type, time window

## Outputs
- Curated analytics marts (Snowflake)
- Monitoring dashboard (Power BI)
- Incident report + anomaly detection (Python)
